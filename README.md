# Bitcoin-Stealer
Generate random bitcoin wallets & private keys (seeds) and then check if they match any wallet that has a positive balance, and then take all the btc from it.

# WANT TO THANK ME?

# REQUIREMENTS
1. Install Node.js
2. npm i coinkey
3. Lots of time on your hands.. there's a lot and I mean A LOT of possible addresses and keys, you will be extremely lucky to find any that will match your list.

# HOW TO RUN
Just start run.bat.

It will start gen.bat, which will start the generator.js. Run.bat will work in background and re-run the generator.js every 100 seconds because at a certain point it would have a memory leak error and we don't want that. But don't worry, it won't interrupt anything you're doing, it will run minimized every time.

# TEST IT
Go to the test folder and hit run. It will show you what would happen if a wallet from your list was found.

# WHY DO THIS?
There are a lot of wallets with high balances that are lost forever, which means nobody can access them and the money is basically there just to be picked up by anyone. This program can possibly find these lost wallets and their matching private keys and take the btc out of them.

# NOTE
I'm not actually responsible for what you do with this. Don't steal active wallet money, that's just wrong. Not to mention the new wallets are most likely protected much more and stuff.

# Also Note
It's almost impossible to find anything. Even though this method is not bruteforce and is creating random keys, the chances of winning are still very very low. You could be lucky though, good luck!
