# Bitcoin-Stealer
Generate random bitcoin wallets, private keys and seeds and then search if they match a wallet that contains some kind of balance, and then basically take it. 

# WANT TO THANK ME?

# HOW TO RUN
Just open run.bat in the folder, it will start node.bat which will start the generator. Run.bat will work in background and re-run the generator every 100 seconds because at a certain point it would have a memory leak error and we don't want that. But don't worry, it won't interrupt anything you're doing, it will run minimized every time.

# REQUIREMENTS
1. Install Node.js
2. npm i coinkey
3. npm i get-random-values
4. Lots of time on your hands.. there's a lot and I mean A LOT of possible addresses, you will be extremely lucky to find any that will match your list.

# TEST IT
Go to the test folder and hit run. It will show you what would happen if a wallet from your list was found.

# WHY DO THIS?
There are a lot of wallets with high balances that are lost forever, this program could possibly find them and take the btc out of them.

# NOTE
I'm not responsible for what you do with this, I made this for fun.
