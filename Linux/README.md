# NOTE LINUX USERS!

Make sure you right click on the .sh files and select Properties -> Permissions and make sure the "allow executing file as program" is checked (enabled). And then to run the .sh programs, you have two options:

- (Easiest way) You can double click on any of the .sh files and select "run in terminal"

- Or you can right click on the project folder, select "open in terminal" and then execute the scripts manually with the following command example: "./run.sh" and hit enter.

# If script isn't running

Make sure "xterm" is installed. Type "apt-get install xterm" in terminal (you need to be root)
